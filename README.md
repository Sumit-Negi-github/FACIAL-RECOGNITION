# FACIAL-RECOGNITION
This is a facial recognition repository  which I have tried to implement from Scratch. 
I have used Python Language .
The code is named by "main.py" python file. 
The images used in the project are in the folder "dataset".
Kindly keep the "dataset" folder and "main.py" under the same directory.

For any difficulty, feel free to read "Report.pdf". It contains detailed desription about the implementation.
